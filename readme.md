# 📂 download-github-files

Download **Individual** 📂 Directories from github. By default github only allows you to download the whole repository. This becomes a issue when you are trying to download
only a small portion of the repository of a large repository. This tool allows you to download what you need and even filter out the files you will download with [globs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) (Note: only available with [downloader mode **1**](#downloader-modes))

> This is a web only project, you can use **git** (require some amount of knowledge) to do this on your own.

## ⚙️ Settings Panel overview

### Github token
![Settings Github token](./docs/settings.png)

The downloader requires a personal access token to be added to the settings panel to view private repositories. this also allows you to have **Higher** api limits.

> [Click here to generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Download%20Github%20Files&scopes=repo)

> [Fine grained access tokens also work](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)


After generating a token, paste the token into the input, make sure "Use Token for requests" is ticked and click Test token

### Downloader Modes

There are currently 3 Downloader modes,

1. Fetch repo and file list - Give the full control to you, the downloader will only fetch the repo and file list and wait for you to click "fetch..." button to continue

2. Fetch repo and Download Files - One step further than 1st mode. on this mode the downloader will download and keep the zip file in memory instead of prompting for saving

3. Fetch repo and Download & Save Files - Download will start on visiting the site and save prompt will appear automatically

## ⚠️ Limitations

#### API Limits

* This tool utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve file lists and their content. As with any API, there are limits. By default, the tool operates in ****Guest** mode, which may have lower API limits.

* If you desire a higher API limit, [create a GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Download%20Github%20Files&scopes=repo) and 
[add it to the settings panel](#github-token) of the downloader. **Remember to refresh the page** after adding the token.

#### Limitation on Private Repositories

* The downloader requires a personal access token to be [added to the settings panel]((#settings-panel-overview)) to view any private repository

> [Click here to generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Download%20Github%20Files&scopes=repo)

> [Fine grained access tokens also work](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)

#### Limitation on Large repositories

Only tested limits for large repositories is the [linux kernel repo](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs) of [2156 Files with total size 42.9 MB](https://typicalninja493.github.io/download-github-files/d?resolve=https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/fs). While even larger amounts are theoretically possible, are not guaranteed. The tool's performance may vary depending on the size and complexity of the repository being accessed.
