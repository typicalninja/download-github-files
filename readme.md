# 📂 download-github-files

Download **Individual** 📂 Directories from github. By default github only allows you to download the whole repository. This becomes a issue when you are trying to download
only a small portion of the repository of a large repository. This tool allows you to bypass this and only download what you need.

# Settings Panel overview

### Github token
![Settings Github token](./docs/settings.png)
The downloader requires a personal access token to be added to the settings panel to view private repositories. this also allows you to have **Higher** api limits.

> [Click here to generate a personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Download%20Github%20Files&scopes=repo)

> [Fine grained access tokens also work](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta)

### Downloader Mode

There are currently 3 Downloader modes,

* Fetch repo and file list - Give the full control to you, the downloader will only fetch the repo and file list and wait for you to click "fetch..." button to continue

* Fetch repo and Download Files - One step further than 1st mode. on this mode the downloader will download and keep the zip file in memory instead of prompting for saving

* Fetch repo and Download & Save Files - Download will start on visiting the site and save prompt will appear automatically

# ⚠️ Limitations

### API Limits

* This tool utilizes the GitHub API to retrieve file lists and their content. As with any API, there are limits. By default, the tool operates in ****Guest** mode, which may have lower API limits.

* If you desire a higher API limit, [creating a GitHub personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=Download%20Github%20Files&scopes=repo) and 
[adding it to the settings panel](#settings-panel-overview) of the downloader **Remember to refresh the page** after adding the token.

* For large repositories this api will try to download the content via a different strategy due to api limitation, however the amount of files downloaded may vary (it may also cost more in resources)

### Limitation on Private Repositories

* The downloader requires a personal access token to be [added to the settings panel]((#settings-panel-overview)) to view private repository
